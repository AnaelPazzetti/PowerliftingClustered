## I'm a powerlifting atlhete and always wondered about the distribution of lifters based on it's lifting level (begginer/advanced)

### So this is just a simple clusterization analysis + RandomForestClassifier (to classify myself and friends based on world lifters)   ### For now it classifies based on a percentil (0-99) top lifters
### By now it's pretty basic but it's base will be reused in another powerlifting related personal project
