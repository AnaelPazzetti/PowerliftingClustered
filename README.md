## I'm a powerlifting atlhete and always wondered about the distribution of lifters based on it's lifting level (begginer/advanced)

### So this is just a simple clusterization analysis + RandomForestClassifier (to classify myself and friends based on world lifters)   ### For now it classifies based on a percentil (0-99) top lifters

### By now it's pretty basic but it's base will be reused in another powerlifting related personal project

# The used data CSV is from [https://openpowerlifting.gitlab.io/opl-csv/files/openipf-latest.zip](https://openpowerlifting.gitlab.io/opl-csv/bulk-csv.html](https://openpowerlifting.gitlab.io/opl-csv/bulk-csv.html)
##the code can easily be changed to use local data instead of fetching from the site
